I opened the slides, now i',m working slide number 10 as i created the new file AmandeepBookStore and checked all the actions over there.
Then, i clicked on the models where i checked the All entities from the database has a 
corresponding model and all columns of 
that table will be the properties of the 
class.
In next given step the pasted the JavaScript scripts below the footer.
I matched the LoginPartial.cshtml with the given slide by professor.
Mainly, LoginPartial.cshtml is used for 
buttons to login and register.
As vlaidationScriptsPartial.cshtml is the next step to check so i checked it.
VlaidationScriptsPartial.cshtml for JQuery responses to validate the model states on the client side.
Next step is to check the Error.cshtml which creates a generic error view (404).
Here i checked ViewImports.cshtml for tag helpers and where custom tag helpers can be created.


Now, i want to take a break and time is 12pm. I'm feeling tired yet excited too to do this assignment. I'll be back after taking a lil break with more energy though and will start the 1.2 debugging (part1).

After took half an hour break I'm back at 12:30pm and i'm going to start the debugging.
Here i go, i clicked at debug button on nav bar and got the output.
I really ecstatic that the output i expect is in front of me which means i succeed the part 1(1.1).

Hence, Part1(1.2) is also completed. Now its 1:30pm and i'm feeling tired so i'm going to sleep and will contoinue from 1.3 part by tommorow.
